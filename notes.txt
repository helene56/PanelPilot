display system
 - show overview of watering cycles in calendar days
 - overview of humidity, light and user input
 - touch capapilities


measurement system
 - measure humidity
 - measure soil capacitance level
 - measure light level

user input system
 - initiate watering cycle
 - user selection of plants, and be able to give plants names/id's

watering plants

- contain water capacity
- move water
- increase air pressure
- pump water

life cycle concepts

- prototype

- service and maintain
- retire

Requirements

- when humidity below 50% water pump shall turn on for 1 min.
- when power buttonpressed on display, display shall turn on for 1 min.
- when user interacts with display, display shall stay on.
- display shall react when buttons pressed on the screen


Time out function
 - Time out after last user interaction
 - timer shall count after ever user interaction and reset

Operational environment
- 10 deg. to 35 deg.
- look up light condition/ luminoucity
- look up humidity inside
- charge and protect battery

display should use 3.3v logic
display should be bluetooth capable
display needs to act as master recieving data from slaves (plant controllers) with the data once a days
if user requests a status update, it should send a requests to the slaves to get most recent data.
